# ITE18midterm
Midterm Project - Title: Nuxt.js (Optional Framework) Authentication with Strapi - ITE18 GP1

In this project, I used React App and Strapi plugins to create/implement a basic authentication system.

## Project Setup

To make this project, you'll need to install React App and its dependencies. Here's how to get started:

1. Install React App:
-> npx create-react-app my-app

2. Install dependencies:
->cd my-app
->npm start

## Configuration

If you need to modify the default configuration of your React app, you can do so by editing the package.json file in your project directory. For example, you can add new dependencies or scripts to your project by adding them to the dependencies and scripts sections of the file.

-> npx create-react-app <app-name> - This command creates a new React app with the specified name using the create-react-app tool.
-> npm start - This command starts the development server and launches the app in a web browser.
-> npm run build - This command builds the app for production and generates a build folder containing the optimized assets and files.
-> npm install <package-name> - This command installs a new package or library as a dependency in the app.
-> npm uninstall <package-name> - This command removes a package or library from the app's dependencies.
-> npm run <script-name> - This command runs a script defined in the package.json file, such as a custom build or test script.

## Usage

TO use react app, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server.
  -type in the terminal (npm start)

2. Open a web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) or you can just type this in the command prompt (npm start) it will automatically navigate you.

3. Use the app to perform the desired actions.
